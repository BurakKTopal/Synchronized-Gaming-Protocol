# Motivation
This protocol was written for a project that was given by the University of Hasselt for the course 'Computer networks'.
This repo contains the following:
<ul>
  <li>The <a href = "https://github.com/BurakKTopal/Synchronized-Gaming-Protocol/blob/main/network_game.py">Client code</a> to play the game.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://github.com/BurakKTopal/Synchronized-Gaming-Protocol/blob/main/Server.py">Server code</a></li>
  <li>All about the documentation of the protocol can be found in <a href="https://github.com/BurakKTopal/Synchronized-Gaming-Protocol/blob/main/Documentation_SGP.md">Documentation_SGP.md</a></li>
  <li>Also a very short recap in the form of a presentation is given in <a href="https://github.com/BurakKTopal/Synchronized-Gaming-Protocol/blob/main/SGP_Protocol_presentation.pdf">SGP_Protocol_presentation.pdf</a></li>
  <li><a href=https://github.com/BurakKTopal/Synchronized-Gaming-Protocol/blob/main/requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a> gives the packages that are needed to run the code.</li>
</ul>
